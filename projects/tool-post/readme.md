# tool-post

Like all mini-lathe owners, I ordered an AXA tool post. Well, first I ordered a BXA but that 
was ridiculously large. So then I ordered an AXA. However, the AXA tool post expects a different
thread on the bottom, and I didn't want to modify my cross slide compound any more than I
already have. So I needed to build an adapter post.

## process

### raw stock

I started with raw stock and machined it to nominal size:

In retrospect, I need to cut my stock longer to give me room to work around the chuck and
the tailstock.


### interim tool-post

After much whittling away of material, I finally crafted a somewhat janky tool post:

The post on the left is a bolt that is used to bootstrap me into the new tool post. I
needed to do this b/c all my thread cutting bits are 1/2" for the new AXA post and 
holders. I used the modified bolt to machine the new tool post, on the right.

### completed tool-post

Here's the completed tool post installing into the compound:

### done

And finally, the AXA tool post all assembled and ready for business:

## lessons learned

* cut stock oversize so tools can grip on either side
* janky interim tooling worked pretty well!
* BXA tool post is just way too big for a mini lathe
* AXA tool post with 1/2" tooling requires tooling to be installed upside down and lathe run in reverse

The last item isn't such a big deal. I kind of like running everything in reverse. This keeps the tooling
away from the chuck and I get to use bigger stiffer tooling. I do miss watching the chips peel off the
stock, but that's a minor nit.

End.
