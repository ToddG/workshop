# disk sander

Thu Mar  3 16:47:53 PST 2022

It seems that all the cool kids have a disc sander, and this seems really useful for shaping
components. Often, I see craftspeople shaping a part to a design that's been glued to a piece
of wood (or metal). And the disk sander seems useful for shaping tools, putting bevels on chisels
perhaps. So this seems like the next logical tool to make in the shop bootstrap process.

## implementation

I have a nice table made of sawhorses and a piece of plywood...

Build the box base...

Doh. Once the disc is assembled, there's no easy way to get the sandpaper
installed on the front of the disc. So the front needs to be removable...

The shaft has milled flats for the set screws in the pillow blocks. These keep
the shaft from moving front or back. This is necessary b/c if the shaft moves
laterally, then the discs could start rubbing on the base and eventually char
and possibly start a fire...ask me how I know this...

The full assembly...

A discarded 1/3 HP motor drives this unit. Honestly 1/3 HP
is not enough power, minimum 1/2 but a full horse would be great...

Used paint from somewhere...

Pillow blocks are secured with threaded inserts and 1/4-20 bolts...

The shop vac is on an auto circuit, so when the sander starts, it
turns on the shop vac...

The sand paper is a bit ragged b/c I wound up sanding the disk down to under
12" in diameter...

The proverbial sanded corner...

That's it for now. It's surprisingly useful as-is.

TODO items that I may or may not get around to are:

* table for precise angles
* cowling for dust collection
* motor mount connections

If I had this to do over again I would:

1. Build the discs to be several inches larger in diameter than the target
   dimension of 12". Because I goofed and drilled the shaft at an angle, I would
   up re-drilling the hole much larger so I could epoxy the shaft in at a more
   perpendicular angle. This is a critical part of the build, and creating a jig
   to guarantee this angle would have been well worth the time and effort.

2. I built this almost entirely from salvaged plywood from the local cabinet
   shop. I'd probably do this again the same way.

3. Check the clearance on the dust collection... My shop vac fitting got ground
   away by the disc without me noticing.


It's definitely a cool tool to have in the shop. One thing that I definitely do
not like tho is that it takes up so much real-estate on my work bench. So while
the design is ingenious, it's a bulky item to store, and bulky to setup. I may
build a cabinet on wheels for this thing and stuff the moter underneath, but
that's a V2 improvement, and I still have tools I need to build as part of the
basic shop build out.
