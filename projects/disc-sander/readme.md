# disk sander

It seems that all the cool kids have a disc sander, and this seems really useful for shaping
components. Often, I see craftspeople shaping a part to a design that's been glued to a piece
of wood (or metal). And the disk sander seems useful for shaping tools, putting bevels on chisels
perhaps. So this seems like the next logical tool to make in the shop bootstrap process.
