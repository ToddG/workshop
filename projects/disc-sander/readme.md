# disk sander

It seems that all the cool kids have a disc sander, and this seems really useful for shaping
components. Often, I see craftspeople shaping a part to a design that's been glued to a piece
of wood (or metal). And the disk sander seems useful for shaping tools, putting bevels on chisels
perhaps. So this seems like the next logical tool to make in the shop bootstrap process.

## implementation

I have a nice table made of sawhorses and a piece of plywood...

Build the box base...

Doh. Once the disc is assembled, there's no easy way to get the sandpaper
installed on the front of the disc. So the front needs to be removable...

The shaft has milled flats for the set screws in the pillow blocks. These keep
the shaft from moving front or back. This is necessary b/c if the shaft moves
laterally, then the discs could start rubbing on the base and eventually char
and possibly start a fire...ask me how I know this...

The full assembly...

A discarded 1/3 HP motor drives this unit. Honestly 1/3 HP
is not enough power, minimum 1/2 but a full horse would be great...

Used paint from somewhere...

Pillow blocks are secured with threaded inserts and 1/4-20 bolts...

The shop vac is on an auto circuit, so when the sander starts, it
turns on the shop vac...

The sand paper is a bit ragged b/c I wound up sanding the disk down to under
12" in diameter...

The proverbial sanded corner...

That's it for now. I may add a table at some point so I can sand precise angles etc.
