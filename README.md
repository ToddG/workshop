# Workshop

I'm improving my shop by increasing the size, precision and accuracy of what I (and my shop) is capable of.

## Projects

### Built

I'm building out a workshop, here's what I've built so far:


* [tool post](./projects/tool-post/readme.md)
* [panel saw](./projects/panel-saw/readme.md)


### TODO


I'm bootstrapping in roughly this order...

* [Learn FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)
* [Upgrade Lathe to AXA tool post](./projects/tool-post/readme.md)
* [Build a panel saw](./projects/panel-saw/readme.md)
* [Build rolling table saw cabinet](./projects/table-saw-cabinet/readme.md)
* rolling chop saw cabinet
* rolling metal work cabinet
* disc sander


I'll post stuff that I design and build along the way. For instance, the beehive project:

* [layens frame](./projects/honey-bees/hives/layens-frame.pdf)


## design tools

### freecad

I'm learning [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/). I have a love hate relationship with this. However, after watching
about 200 hours of tutorial videos, I think I finally get it. I vastly prefer to support FOSS rather than become
vendor locked into a proprietary (and expensive) product.
