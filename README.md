# Workshop

I'm improving my shop by increasing the size, precision and accuracy of what I (and my shop) is capable of.

## design tools

### freecad

I'm learning [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/). I have a love hate relationship with this. However, after watching
about 200 hours of tutorial videos, I think I finally get it. I vastly prefer to support FOSS rather than become
vendor locked into a proprietary (and expensive) product.
